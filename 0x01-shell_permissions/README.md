# Understanding the Linux access and permissions

#### The Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing systems in that they are not only multitasking but also multi-user. This means that more than one user can be operating the computer at the same time. While a desktop or laptop computer only has one keyboard and monitor, it can still be used by more than one user.
  - chmod - modify file access rights
  - su - temporarily become the superuser
  - sudo - temporarily become the superuser
  - chown - change file ownership
  - chgrp - change a file's group ownership
---
On a Linux system, each file and directory is assigned access rights for the owner of the file, the members of a group of related users, and everybody else. Rights can be assigned to read a file, to write a file, and to execute a file (i.e., run the file as a program).

To see the permission settings for a file, we can use the ls command. As an example, we will look at the bash program which is located in the /bin directory:

  - r means read with a value of 4
  - w means write with a value of 2
  - x means execute with a value of 1

Octal notation method; think of the permission settings as a series of bits.

  - the first three sets of rwx is for the owner(called the user represented with u)
  - the second three sets of rwx is for the group(represented with g)
  - the first three sets of rwx is for the others(represented with o)
